## Coming Soon

In the talk, a few patterns were mentioned in relation to migrating BFFs to a Federated GraphQL API.  

Code examples are in progress with working BFFs, clients that transition from the BFFs to the federated GraphQL endpoint, and the subsequent Apollo Router, subgraphs, and microservice applications powering these subgraphs.
